1) WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

This week, we created all pages that our site will offer. We started
working on the front-end of our project, writing HTML and CSS code
to set up each page.


2) CHALLENGES AND ISSUES

So far, we have not faced any significant issues.


3) GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK

Our main goal for the coming week is to acquire the data for the team's
schedules which we have access to. With this data, we can begin to
work on the server side of this project, and to fill in the pages
which we have set up with the data using Javascript code. We also plan
to create a style sheet to make the appearance of our site more
cohesive and appealing.
