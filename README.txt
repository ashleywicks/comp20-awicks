PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY

This repository contains most of the work which I have completed
for Comp 20 Web Programming in Spring 2018, including labs and
assignments.

=====================================================================
FAVORITE ASSIGNMENT

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3, because before completing
this assigment it was unclear how the server side functioned and
interacted with the client side. This assignment shed some light
under the hood and helped me to connect the dots, ultimately
producing a full application. I also enjoyed how this assignment
modeled familiar ride-sharing apps that I use all the time, lending
it a real-world focus.

=====================================================================
GROWTH FROM DAY 1 TO NOW

I came into this course with some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
Javascript, thinking there was not much more to know for web
development. This course revealed just how much detail and complexity
goes into producing a full scale web application, from the client
side to the server side. Coming out of this course, I realize that
the material covered only begins to scratch the surface of web
development, and I have a newfound appreciation for web devs.

=====================================================================
MOST IMPORTANT THING LEARNED

The most important thing I learned in this course was how to research
and teach myself. This course does not teach many useful web
frameworks, but for good reason: these frameworks can be taught to
oneself outside of the classroom, if one is resourceful enough.
For example, for the final project, I learned how to use Bootstrap,
which was never explicitly taught in the course. I also learned how
to read documentation, such as for the Javascript Date object for
Assignment 3. Along the way, I learned to ask for help from TAs
and peers when I got stuck. These are all invaluable "real-world"
skills which will serve me well as I move forward in my career.

=====================================================================
GOING FORWARD

Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve deeper
into learning about web security. This course emphasized the
importance of security, how much most undergraduate programs are
lacking in security curriculum, and how much most applications today
suffer from security vulnerabilities. Thus, I think that being
well-versed in cybersecurity could give me an edge in the hiring
process.
