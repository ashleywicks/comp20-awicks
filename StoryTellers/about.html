	<h1>What is StoryTellers?</h1>
	<p>It doesn't matter where you're from, where you've been or who you are, we all have stories to tell. Those stories could be made up or from your personal experience. But storytelling doesn't need to be a one-way street, with an audience and one speaker. The best stories are those in which multiple people contribute and lend their perspectives and their expertise. Here at StoryTellers, we facilitate collaborative storytelling in many different forms in hopes of enhancing the sharing of stories worldwide, and of making people happy.</p>
