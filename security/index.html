<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have been hired as a security consultant to document privacy and security
   vulnerabilities in a web application, on both the client side and the server
   side. This application allows passengers and vehicles to request a ride or
   look for passengers, respectively, by sending information to a server about
   their coordinates. The server sends back information about either vehicles
   or passengers, which is rendered on a map for the client.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>I first conducted "black box testing", meaning that I attempted attacks on the
   application without reviewing the source code. For example, I used the /rides
   POST API with curl to insert a malicious script into the application.</p>
<p>Next, I conducted "white box testing", meaning that I read the source code and
   looked for vulnerabilities in the code. For example, after looking at the
   server code in index.js, I suspected that I could use database injection to
   access user information, since user input was not sanitized. </p>
<p>The tool that I used most for this security assessment was curl, to post
   data to the server using the "/rides" API. I also wrote some of my own code,
   pictured below, to expose other vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>This application was found to have many security and privacy vulnerabilities.
   The server blindly trusts all user input, and does not protect against
   user input which could contain, for example, malicious code that could be
   executed when certain sections of the application. It is possible for anyone
   from any domain, without knowledge of any username, to access all data
   about vehicles on this site, including location. This is a major privacy issue,
   and this application should increase its security to hide private user
   information.</p>

<h1>Issues Found</h1>
<div>
<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>Cross-site scripting for "/" GET route</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>This issue was found when visiting https://ancient-dusk-55721.herokuapp.com/
   on a browser using the "/" GET route, after injecting a script into the database
   of passengers using the "/rides" POST route, and then </p>
<h3>Severity</h3>
<p>The severity of this issue is high. A cross-site scripting attack has the ability
   to present users with fraudulent web content, steal cookie information, and inject
   malicious code into web pages. This is a very common vulnerability which is
   important to protect against when designing web applications.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I found this issue by navigating to the directory of the server in a terminal and
   executing this command:</p>
<p>curl --data "username='&lt;script&gt;alert(123)&lt;/script&gt;'&lat=10&lng=10" https://ancient-dusk-55721.herokuapp.com/rides"</p>
<p>This command sends data to the server which contains a malicious script, which
   is then injected into the database. When a user uses the "/" GET route to view
   passengers who have requested a ride, the script is injected into the HTML and
   is executed.</p>
<h3>Proof of vulnerability</h3>
<p>Here is an screenshot of the site https://ancient-dusk-55721.herokuapp.com/, after
   a script was injected.</p>
<img src="xss_get.png" alt="Cross-site scripting attack" />
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>One good way to protect against a cross-site scripting attack is to remove all
   special characters from user input. It is very important to never trust user input!
   Another way is to change "<" to "lt" and to change ">" to "gt", so that no script\
   tags remain.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>Database injection with MongoDB</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>This issue was found using the "/vehicle.json" GET route. </p>
<h3>Severity</h3>
<p>The severity of this issue is high. By injecting Mongo queries
   into the parameters of a request, hackers could access information
   about users, including their location. This is an issue of privacy,
   since the location of users should be kept hidden.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I found this issue by inserting private user information into the database
   using the "/rides" POST route with curl, and then going to the URL
   https://ancient-dusk-55721.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username[$ne]=null&lat=10&lng=10/
   in a web browser. Here is an screenshot of the address bar:</p>
<img src="database_injection2.png" alt="Database injection attack" />
<h3>Proof of vulnerability</h3>
<p>Here is an screenshot of the site
   https://ancient-dusk-55721.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username[$ne]=null&lat=10&lng=10/,
   which shows sensitive user information:</p>
<img src="database_injection.png" alt="Database injection result" />
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>The best way to prevent against database injection is simply by
   sanitizing user input, such as stripping all special characters or
   any keys that contain "$" in the input.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>Bad programming practice: CORS enabled with wildcard</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>This issue was found using the "/rides" POST route. </p>
<h3>Severity</h3>
<p>The severity of this issue is high. Since cross-origin resource sharing
   (CORS) in enabled for the POST route, any domain can access private user
   information, including username and location. (For example, read
   <a href="https://steemit.com/facebook/@schattenjaeger/vulnerability-allowed-hackers-to-read-private-facebook-conversations">
   	Vulnerability Allowed Hackers to Read Private Facebook Conversations
   </a>).</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I found this issue by writing a separate HTML file, which could have been
   written by anyone with malicious intent. This HTML file sends a POST request
   to the server with a fake username, which then returns data about all vehicle
   users, which I then displayed on the page. Here is the code that I used to
   perform this attack:</p>
<img src="cors_code.png" alt="code for CORS attack"/>
<h3>Proof of vulnerability</h3>
<p>Here is an screenshot of the site hacks.html which I coded, which shows sensitive
   user information for vehicles:</p>
<img src="cors_result.png" alt="result of CORS attack" />
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>It is usually very bad practice to use CORS with a wildcard (*). CORS should
   be enabled only for trusted domains, except for open data situations. Thus, CORS
   should be disabled on the server side for all unknown sites, since user data
   should be kept private. At the very least, the server should verify that the
   given username is in a list of known usernames for the site. </p>
</div>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This report underlines a few major security and privacy vulnerabilities of this site.
   All of the resolutions recommended above should be followed to hide sensitive user
   information and to protect against malicious attacks. These are all quick fixes, about
   one line of code for each. After these fundamental issues have been addressed, the
   application should undergo a more thorough security assessment. Tools like 
   <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a> can be used as a scanner and
   proxy. The community edition is free, while the professional edition costs $349 per year.
   Many tools also offer a spidering tool. Scanners can scan entire pages for potential
   vulnerabilities. More generally, it is good to be aware of the 
   <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top Ten</a>, a
   list of some of the most common and critical security risks for applications.</p>
